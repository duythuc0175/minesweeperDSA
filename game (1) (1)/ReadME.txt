Some things to note about the game (Game Rules included when game is run): 

- Similar to traditional Minesweeper game except the user has the option to "save" game status and undo 
any number of moves. 

- The user can only undo moves after he/she has played any moves, which is true even when the previous 
saved game status is reloaded, i.e, the user cannot undo moves he/she made in that previous round 
(If the game is reloaded with 2 flagged cells from the previous round, the user cannot undo those 2
flagged cells, but can undo the 3rd flagged cell, which would count as the user's first move in this new round). 

- The game status is automatically saved when the user exits out the window, and is given the option of 
whether they want to restore previous status or start a new game when the game is reopened.

-On the Mac, right click is clicking the keypad with 2 fingers.

=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an appropriate use of the concept. Incorporate the feedback you got after
  submitting your proposal.

Note: In my proposal, I discussed how I was going to use class inheritance/dynamic dispatch 
as one of my main concepts, but am no longer doing so given the lack of complexity in my class structure. 
Although the idea is still incorporated in my design, I am not using it to count towards any requirement. 
I discuss this topic more when I discuss the “stumbling blocks” of this project. 

  1. 2D Array

Since Minesweeper takes place on a 16x16 grid, I used a 2-D array of “Cell” objects
 to represent the grid to store the state of each cell in the grid in terms of which 
 cells contain bombs, if they are empty, or if they are neighbor of bomb cells (i.e “number’ cells). 
 “Cell” was a parent class I created that stores the properties of each cell and handles basic cell 
 behavior depending on its type. The 2-D array was used whenever a new game was started, 
 in which the 2-D array would be randomly filled with bomb cells, number cells (cells that are neighbors to bomb 
 cells indicating how many bombs are in the vicinity), or empty cells. I would traverse through a double for loop 
 that represents the rows and columns of the 2-D array or call individual elements of the 2-D array to initialize 
 Cell objects, handle different user actions on a specific cell, or obtain information about about a certain cell 
 (to read from/write into a text file when saving and loading the game status). My use of a 2-D array was extremely
  fundamental in organizing my overall structure of the game board and locating user actions/specifying desired 
 locations to handle game logic. 

  2. File I/O

I used a File I/O to store and save 1) the player’s username and 2) the game state in a
 file when user wants to close the game and play again later. The state of the grid in 
terms was represented by the 2D array is stored in a file, which is loaded again when 
user wants to continue the game from before. The properties of each cell are saved in a text file,
and when player wants to load the game, the file is read and parsed. In the text file, each line 
represents a the saved state of a cell (256 lines in total, representing the 256 total cells), 
with 4 pieces of information, converted to “String” type: 1) the cell type 2) whether the cell 
is marked 3) whether the cell is flagged 4) if applicable, what the number on the cell is 
(only for cells indicating the number of bombs nearby). The username and game state are separated
 by the “$” character, and each cell in the 2D array game state is separated by a whitespace 
 hyphen whitespace “ - “. 

  3. Collections

I decided to add a feature to my Minesweeper game in which a user can "undo" their moves 
when they hit the "undo" button, unless the user hits a bomb, which then the game ends. 
I implemented the undo function by storing the user moves in a Collections called Stack, 
which takes advantage of the "last in first out" property to undo the user's most recent step by
"popping" it out of the Stack — removing the user move from the Stack and returning the values 
(the state of the cell depending on the user’s last click). I also use the "push" function to add steps
to the Stack whenever the user left clicks a number or empty cell, and right clicks to flag/unflag a cell,
which represents the user’s most recent move. The user can undo any number of moves for any type of move, 
which includes clicking on flagged cells, empty cells, and neighbor cells, but for bomb cells, the
 Undo function is disabled (to ensure the game is over when a bomb is clicked) by “clearing” the Stack. 

  4. Recursion

I used recursion to reveal and clear a mine-free region of cells, specifically, when a user 
clicks on a cell that has no bombs with adjacent cells also bomb-free so all adjacent cells are 
automatically cleared and the region with bomb-free cells is revealed up until the cell that is 
until the cell is not empty. Originally, I was going to use recursion to calculate the neighboring bomb cells, 
and realized that could be implemented with a for loop. Recursion was the most elegant way to implement this feature 
however, given the unnecessary amount/messy nature of for loops in this case. 


=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.

Mines: 
- The entry point and UI design of the game
- Implements the layout of the UI from Java Swing
- Handles basic user input for them to type in their name
- Has a window listener that listens to when the window is closed so the game state 
   is automatically saved when the user exits out 


Given that the grid is comprised of individual cells, all of which can be thought of as objects, 
with each cell sharing certain basic properties/functionalities, it made sense to implement some 
type of class inheritance (not necessarily to count towards a requirement). 

Cell (parent class): stores properties of each cell like whether it’s covered, flagged, 
what type of cell; has basic functionality like getting the image corresponding to the name of cell,
 changing its stated of being marked 
- BombCell (extends Cell)
- NeighborOfBombCell (extends Cell)
    - Keeps track of the bombs nearby 
- EmptyCell (extends Cell) 

The cells all have two constructors, one which take in no input 
(just when initializing the game board for a new round) and one which takes 
in information about whether a cell is marked, covered, or if applicable, 
how many bombs are nearby, when re-initializing the state of the gameboard, l
oading a previously saved game status from the text file which keeps track of each cell based on aformentioned properties. 


Board: 
- Main controller and view
- Handles user actions (either left or right click on an empty cell, bomb cell, or number cell) and 
performs or displays desired moves/information accordingly using paint and event listeners 
    - contains private class called MinesAdapter that makes changes based on user action (mouse clicks) so it's easier
   	  to access fields and information from the Board class directly
    - Stores all images of these different types of cells in a map and displays images according to cells clicked
    - Contains recursive function to clear a bomb-free region of empty cells and is called when user clicks on an empty cell 
- Handles saving and loading functionality
- Initializes game board depending on whether user has selected new game or wants to continue from the previous state
- Stores user moves whenever user clicks the board, and handles the “undo” functionality whenever the user desires to remove a move

CellType and ImageName classes: enums used to represent the different types of cells and images in a cleaner, more readable way 




- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?

I was previously going to use Class inheritance/dynamic dispatch for one of my four concepts and
realized given the way my game is designed, it’s not actually necessary to represent the cells as
classes since my classes mainly store the cell properties. For a while, I was struggling to find 
a way to change my class inheritance design just to fit the requirement instead of actually thinking
about what made sense. I was trying to add a functionality in the "Cell: class in which each cell 
can change its behavior when clicked on, but realized I was already handling that in the Board class 
depending on the user's type of mouse click. I realized that such a way of programming was bad practice and 
necessary - while there was no unique behavior associated with each class, the classes were 
still a good way of organizing and storing information about each cell which would determine the 
events that occur on the game board based on user actions. 




- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?

Overall, I believe there was a good separation of functionality given that each class 
had its individual purpose, each contributing to the model-view-controller paradigm I employed 
to design my game. There was no repeats in using different types of collections or data structures 
to store the same type of data, or different methods that would result in the same game functionality 
(e.g., allowing user to unflag a cell by toggling the right click on/off, as well as through an undo feature 
— this was actually what I initially had but made the undo feature extend to all types of moves to
 differentiate functionality). 

Encapsulation was properly implemented as all my variables are private or protected 
(if I wanted to access fields across classes). Examples of protected fields include whether 
a cell is covered or marked in the Cell class, which is information I utilize when writing the 
state of each cell into a text file for my save feature. 

If I were to refactor, I would try to implement more functionalities to make the game more interesting
and support more user interaction. For example, I'd add more levels to this game (easy, medium, hard), 
which would include more bombs, a bigger board, and perhaps a timer function.
